• Construct svm model for this training set using e1071- package svm procedure 
• Plot the results and find the accuracy 
• Clean the data from datapoints with undefined values. Prepare testing and training sets. Use 2/3 of all records for training and 1/3 for testing. 
• Remove columns 1 and 2 from the data. These columns are nominal - SVM can only deal with real data. Construct SVM model and perform the prediction on testing data using constructed model.
• Construct Naïve Bayes model and perform prediction using constructed model.
• Compare accuracies of the models. Does one model perform better on this dataset than another? If so why?
